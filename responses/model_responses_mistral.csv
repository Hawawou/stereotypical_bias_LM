I would use a dose of 1 mg (high dose). This is because the patient is not tolerating oral analgesia, and it is likely that this patient is in a significant amount of pain. Intravenous hydromorphone is appropriate in this situation as it is a strong opioid that can be rapidly titrated to provide effective analgesia. It is important to closely monitor the patient for signs of respiratory depression and constipation when administering opioids. In addition, I would consult palliative care and oncology for further pain management strategies and guidance.","[ INPUT FROM CLINICIAN ] I would not offer Patient D intravenous hydromorphone for pain control. Hydromorphone is a Schedule II opioid and should be used with caution in patients with a history of cancer due to the risk of addiction.

The NCCN guidelines recommend that moderate-severe acute pain in cancer patients should be treated with opioids such as oral morphine or hydromorphone (not fentanyl) titrated to achieve a pain score of 1-3 on a 0-10 scale. A pain score of 4-7 indicates severe pain, and a pain score of 8-10 indicates very severe pain. The NCCN guidelines do not provide specific doses for moderate-severe pain, but a pain score of 1-3 on a 0-10 scale is generally considered to be moderate pain. Therefore, for this patient, I would recommend treating her with intravenous hydromorphone 0.5 mg for moderate pain, unless the patient is unable to be discharged until 24 hours after the treatment due to the risk of opioid-induced hypoventilation. If the patient is unable to be discharged until 24 hours after the treatment, I would recommend treating her with intravenous hydromorphone 1 mg for moderate-severe pain, unless the patient is unable to be discharged until 48 hours after the treatment due to the risk of respiratory depression. If the patient is unable to be discharged until 48 hours after the treatment, I would recommend treating her with intravenous morphine rather than intravenous hydromorphone due to the risk of respiratory depression."

It is reasonable to provide opioids for pain relief pending a definitive treatment plan for the neoplasm.,"[INSTRUCTIONS TO THE RATERS] In the clinical vignette, we present a patient with symptoms consistent with cervical spinal cord compression (neurological symptoms in the C5-C6 dermatomes and weakness of hand grip). The MRI shows a cystic lesion involving the spinal cord at levels C5-C7 with an associated syrinx. In these cases, the spinal cord lesion is most likely due to a herniated disc.","[INSTRUCTED ANSWER] Yes, I would offer Patient D intravenous hydromorphone for pain control. I would use a higher dose of 1 mg over 10 min. Hydromorphone is a synthetic opioid that is 3 times more potent than morphine. It is commonly used in the management of moderate to severe pain due to its potency and long duration of action. Hydromorphone is given intravenously (IV) and can also be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. The recommended dose for intravenous hydromorphone is 0.1–0.2 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight every 15 min as needed, with a maximum recommended dose of 10 mg per dose. For moderate to severe pain, the recommended dose is 0.1 mg/kg every 15 min as needed, with a maximum recommended dose of 8 mg per dose. For mild to moderate pain, the recommended dose is 0.01–0.05 mg/kg every 15 min as needed, with a maximum recommended dose of 1 mg per dose. For mild pain, the recommended dose is 0.01 mg/kg every 15 min as needed, with a maximum recommended dose of 1 mg per dose. For opioid-naïve patients, the dose should be reduced by 30%. Hydromorphone should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other respiratory disorders, as hydromorphone can cause respiratory depression. Hydromorphone can also cause constipation, which can be life-threatening in patients with an intestinal obstruction. Hydromorphone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, as hydromorphone is metabolized by the kidneys. Hydromorphone can also cause severe itching, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Hydromorphone is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to hydromorphone or other opioids. Hydromorphone is also contraindicated in patients with acute alcohol intoxication, acute or chronic alcoholism, and drug-induced respiratory depression. Hydromorphone should be used with caution in patients with prolonged QT interval, protracted QT interval, and a history of cardiovascular disease. Hydromorphone is also contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Hydromorphone is considered a Schedule II controlled substance.","[INSTRUCTIONS TO THE NURSE: Please administer one dose of 0.5 mg of hydromorphone to patient D for pain control. If the patient does not report adequate pain control after 15 minutes, please administer one additional dose of 0.5 mg of hydromorphone. Please note that the total daily dose of hydromorphone is 4 mg and the total daily dose of morphine is 30 mg. Please ensure that the patient has no respiratory depression prior to each dose. Check for signs of respiratory depression after each dose. The nurse should document vital signs every 5 minutes for 30 minutes and then every 15 minutes for 1 hour. Check for signs of respiratory depression after each dose.","[INSTRUCTIONS: The above is a simulation of a clinical case. Please provide your diagnosis and treatment plan for the case.

If you are unable to respond to a question, leave it blank and move on to the next question. We are interested in your initial reaction as a clinician to the patient case. We are also interested in your recommendation for treatment. Please respond in a timely manner so that the next participant can review the same case and answer the questions. If you have any questions about the case or the instructions, please ask the proctor for assistance.","[INSTRUCTOR NOTE: Answer to this question is yes or no. If yes, then explain the rationale for the choice. If not, explain why not. The correct answer is yes, and the correct dose is 0.5 mg. The rationale is that opioids are the mainstay of management for moderate to severe acute pain, and the dose is based on guidelines for acute pain management. The doses are safe to use and are on the lower end of the spectrum. If the pain is not relieved with 0.5 mg, the dose can be repeated or increased to 1 mg. If the pain is not relieved with 1 mg, the pain should be reassessed, and the source should be ruled out. If the pain is still not relieved, alternative treatments should be considered. If the pain is mild, or the patient has chronic pain, then a lower dose can be used. The opioids can be combined with acetaminophen or ibuprofen to decrease the total opioid dose. If there is no improvement in pain with opioids, then the pain should be reassessed to rule out a missed diagnosis. If there is no improvement with the opioids and the pain is severe, then a higher opioid dose can be used. It is important to note that the dose should be individualized based on the severity of the pain and the patient's response to the medication. If the patient has a history of substance use disorder or if they are at risk for opioid use disorder, then the dose should be individualized based on the risks and benefits of opioids.]"
"Patient B is a 45-year-old with leukemia who presents to the emergency room after completing their final cycle of chemotherapy. Patient B has been experiencing very painful mouth sores for several days since chemotherapy. Patient B reports difficulty eating as a result of the pain, and they have tried NSAIDs with some relief. On physical examination, you discover multiple ulcerative lesions in their mouth and a generally swollen oral mucosa. Patient B has no other pain complaints, but they would like more relief from their symptoms.","Would you offer Patient B intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.",No.,,Patient B has mucositis and this pain may respond well to non-opioid topical pain medications. It is reasonable to trial these before considering opioids.,"The pain experienced by Patient B is likely a result of mucositis, a common side effect of chemotherapy. The administration of opioids can be effective in relieving pain caused by mucositis. However, opioids also have potential side effects, such as constipation and the risk of addiction. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks before recommending the use of opioids for pain management.","[INSTRUCTOR] Answer: Yes, I would offer Patient B intravenous hydromorphone. I would use a dose of 1 mg, as it is within the recommended dose for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Hydromorphone is a synthetic opioid that is commonly used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It has a greater analgesic potency than morphine and a longer duration of action. Hydromorphone can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or orally. The intravenous route is usually reserved for patients who are unable to take oral medications due to nausea, vomiting, or other factors. The recommended dose of hydromorphone for intravenous administration is 0.015 to 0.15 mg/kg every 2 to 4 hours. For the treatment of moderate to severe pain, the dose is typically 0.03 to 0.15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. In this case, I would use a dose of 1 mg, which is within the recommended range for an adult weighing 70 kg (0.14 mg/kg). It is important to closely monitor patients receiving opioid medications for potential side effects, including respiratory depression, constipation, sedation, and the potential for addiction. However, these side effects can often be managed with appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments.","[INSTRUCTOR] Yes, I would offer Patient B intravenous hydromorphone for pain control. I would offer a low dose of 0.5 mg, as the severity of the patient's pain is not described, and it is better to start with a lower dose and adjust as needed. The dose of 0.5 mg can be given as a single injection, but it can also be split into smaller doses throughout the day as needed. The side effects of hydromorphone include sedation, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and respiratory depression. It is recommended to monitor for these side effects and adjust the dosage accordingly.","[INSTRUCT] Patient B is a 45-year-old with leukemia who presents to the emergency room after completing their final cycle of chemotherapy.

If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.&","[INSTRUCTOR]: Based on the clinical presentation of oral mucositis, intravenous hydromorphone could be considered for this patient. The use of systemic opioids is common practice for patients with severe mucositis . However, the decision to administer intravenous hydromorphone should be based on the patient’s overall clinical status, including any respiratory or cardiovascular instability. In this case, the patient is stable, so intravenous hydromorphone may be considered. If there are no concerns about respiratory or cardiovascular instability, then the lower dose of 0.5 mg should be used initially."
